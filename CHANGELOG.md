## [0.1.27]

- Upgraded Cline SDK to stable v0.0.4, replacing nightly builds for more reliable native Cline sessions

## [0.1.26]

- Trashing a task now saves a git patch of any uncommitted work, and restoring it from trash automatically reapplies those changes so nothing gets lost
- "Create more" toggle in the new task dialog lets you create multiple tasks in a row without reopening the dialog each time
- New keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+G toggles the git history view, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S opens settings, and Esc closes git history from the home screen
- Shortcut commands now safely interrupt any running terminal process before executing, so commands no longer get jumbled with whatever was previously running
- Agent file-read activity now shows the full list of files being accessed instead of truncating with "(+N more)"
- Expanding the diff view now automatically closes the terminal panel to avoid overlapping views
- Task worktree cleanup no longer gets stuck when patch capture fails
- Fixed the "Thinking..." indicator incorrectly appearing while the agent is actively streaming a response
- Native Cline sessions now correctly capture their latest changes when entering review
- Removed the redundant "Projects" label below the sidebar segment tabs
- Consistent spacing and alignment across all alert dialogs
- Fixed terminal background color in the detail view to match the rest of the overlay

- The agent can now trash and delete tasks on your behalf using new task management commands
- When no CLI agent is detected, a guided setup flow walks you through getting started
- Replaced the Kanban skill system with `--append-system-prompt` -- since the board now has a dedicated agent, we just append context to its prompt instead of maintaining a separate skill
- Native Cline SDK chat runtime with cancelable turns
- `--host` flag to bind the server to a custom IP address
- Submodules are now initialized automatically in new task worktrees
- Fix Escape key unexpectedly closing the detail view

## [0.1.9]

- Fix worktree paths with symlinks in ignored directories being incorrectly treated as active

## [0.1.8]

- Terminal now properly renders full-screen TUI applications like OpenCode
- Fixed terminal content disappearing and scroll back being lost when opening a task. Terminals are now created proactively for each agent instead of connecting mid-session, which preserves full scroll back and content rendering. This is especially important for rendering TUI apps like Codex and Droid correctly.
- Improved terminal rendering quality, inspired by VS Code's xterm and node-pty implementation. Noticeably higher FPS, smoother scrolling, and a more native look and feel for terminal emulators.

## [0.1.7]

- When a task prompt mentions creating tasks (e.g. "break down into tasks", "create 3 tickets", "split into cards"), Kanban now shows a setup dialog offering to install the Kanban MCP before the task starts
- Similar setup dialogs appear for Linear and GitHub CLI when task prompts reference those services
- MCP server instructions now guide agents to detect the ephemeral worktree path and pass the main worktree as projectPath, so "add tasks in kanban" tasks correctly create tasks in the main workspace instead of the ephemeral task worktree

## [0.1.6]

- Show live hook activity (tool calls, file edits, command runs) on task cards as agents work
- Auto-confirm Codex workspace trust prompts so tasks start without manual intervention
- Show working copy changes in the detail panel's git history
- Fix terminal pane state bleeding across tasks when switching between them
- Fix duplicate paste events in agent terminals
- Stop detail terminals when trashing tasks to free resources

- Dogfood launcher for quickly opening Kanban on its own repo with runtime port selection
- Terminal rebuilt around xterm and node-pty for better performance and reliability
- Filter terminal device attribute auto-responses from being sent to agents as input
- Fix workspace metadata causing unnecessary rerenders, with retry recovery
- Fix task worktrees being recreated when the base ref updates if they already exist
- Fix self-ignored directories being symlinked in task worktrees
- Fix bypass permissions toggle resetting unexpectedly
- Fix git refs not clearing when switching detail scope

## [0.1.4]

- Each task gets its own CLI agent working in a git worktree, so they can work in parallel on the same codebase without stepping on each other
- When an agent finishes, review diffs and leave comments before deciding what to merge
- Commit or open a PR directly from the board, and the agent writes the commit message or PR description for you
- Link tasks together to create dependency chains, where one task finishing kicks off the next, letting you complete large projects end to end
- "Automatically commit" and "automatically open PR" toggles give agents more autonomy to complete work on their own
- MCP integration lets agents add and start tasks on the board themselves, decomposing large work into parallelizable linked tasks
- Built-in git visualizer shows your branches and commit history so you can track the work your agents are doing
